# Real-Time Character Counter & Input Validator 🚀

A lightweight, high-performance character counter built with **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project focuses on efficient **DOM manipulation** and real-time user feedback.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks every keystroke using JavaScript Event Listeners.
* **Dynamic Feedback:** Updates the character count instantly as the user types.
* **Input Validation:** Changes UI styles when the character limit is reached to alert the user.
* **Fully Responsive:** Works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Used
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Utilized `addEventListener`, `keyup`, and string length properties.
* **DOM API:** Efficiently updated the DOM without using heavy libraries.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling for a clean, professional user interface.
* **HTML5:** Structured semantic markup for accessibility.

## 📖 How it Works
The application uses a `keyup` event listener attached to the text area. It captures the `value.length` of the input and injects it into a counter element. If the length exceeds a predefined limit, a CSS class is dynamically toggled to change the color/UI.

## 🚀 Why This Matters
For FinTech applications (like Zorvyn), precise input validation is crucial for security and data integrity. This project demonstrates my ability to handle user input securely and provide immediate feedback.
